# Testimonial Card

### Starter code

This starter template consists of the following files and directories:

```bash
├── README.md
├── css
│   └── style.css
├── designs
├── img
├── index.html
└── js
    └── index.js
```

- `README.md`: This file.
- `designs`: Responsive design images for the challenge. Your submission will be compared against some or all of these images.
- `index.html`: Entrypoint for your website. You should be editing this file.
- `css`: For writing any custom CSS styles to customize the appearance of the page.
- `js`: For writing any custom JavaScript to add interactivity to the page.
- `img`: Image assets used by the challenge.

### Deploy your site

Deployment is the process of putting your website's code onto publicly-accessible web servers so that anyone in the world can visit your website.

We recommend the following hosting providers where you can deploy your website for free:

- [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/): If you are using the default starter code template hosted on a public GitHub repository, this is the easiest and fastest way to get your site deployed.
- [Vercel](https://www.vercel.com/): Vercel offers a one-click deployment experience just by connecting your GitHub repository and they have a generous free tier. Could be overkill for hosting static files that don't require a build step.
- [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/): Similar offerings as Vercel.
